Converted data types and created new columns: TotalAmount, InvoiceMonth, InvoiceYear

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Top products by quantity and revenue

Revenue by country

Monthly sales trends

Frequent customers and average order value

Visualizations

Line plots for monthly sales trends

Bar charts for top products and country revenue

Histograms for unit price distribution

Correlation heatmaps for numeric columns

-- Business Insights --

Top products generate majority of revenue — focus promotions and inventory here

Few countries contribute most of the revenue — prioritize marketing and logistics

Seasonal trends in sales can help plan campaigns and inventory

Identifying frequent customers helps in retention and loyalty programs
